# Contributing to Break Management App

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Break Management App as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
We use GitHub Flow. So all code changes happen through Pull Requests.

## We Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
We use Conventional Commits for commit messages. This helps with automated changelog generation.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/break_manage/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/break_manage/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
